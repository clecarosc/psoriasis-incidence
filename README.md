# Examining the incidence of psoriasis in Chile using the Waiting List Repository Database

In this repository is the source code of a work actually in progress which aims to estimate incidence rates of psoriasis in Chile for the 2016-2017 period. The pre-processing of the data from the Chilean Waiting List Repository Database was made with `python`and the analysis was performed with `R`.

A report of preliminary results was presented at the World Congress of Dermatology in Milan in june, 2019. The abstract could be found [here](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/abstracts/35-psoriasis/estimation-of-psoriasis-incidence-and-5357.pdf) and the poster [here](https://github.com/clecarosc/Apuntes_MIM_2018/blob/master/lecaros_poster.pdf)
